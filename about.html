                <p> When we started Orlando WebCrafters, as team members of Orlando Science High School’s competitive
                    math and programming teams, we knew our way around a 3.6 GHz 16 GB processor, and seemingly endless
                    Diophantine equations, but Orlando WebCrafters presented us with a new type of challenge. Creating
                    personalized custom websites, built to accomplish the goals and needs of our clients. What
                    we soon learned, is that it takes a kind of dedication to detail that goes above and beyond
                    skills we honed in the classroom. That’s why, since then, we’ve strived to bring you the best
                    and broadest array of options, as we continue to learn and expand our library of capabilities
                    every day tailoring to the intricate needs of each and every one of our clients.</p>

        <span class="border"></span>
        <p> Minh Le is a senior at Orlando Science High School. Over the past few years, he’s
            developed an interest and passion for programming from participating in his school’s
            FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge teams as Head of the Programming & Electrical
            Division. He’s also worked to organize and teach robotics and coding classes at the Orlando
            Science School’s Math Summer Camp and the Winter Park Public Library. Outside of robotics,
            he is the president and co-founder of his school’s Computer Science Honor Society and enjoys
            learning and applying new programming languages such as Python and C. Designing websites and apps
            is a challenge that Minh has gladly taken on, as he is always eager to expand the boundaries
            of his programming skills. </p>

        <span class="border"></span>
        <p> Wade Twyford is a senior at Orlando Science High School. Wade lives and breathes mathematics.
            He’s the founder of Problem Solved, a non-profit math tutoring service for students from
            elementary to high school. He’s also a gold medalist at the International Mathleague Tournament.
            His complete adoration for math led him to his second love, programming. “Computers and I get
            along very well,” he says, “it’s easy when you both speak the same language.” Since then,
            co-founding his school’s Computer Science Honor Society, as well as Orlando WebCrafters.
            From the time he wrote out his first equation, he had signed his fate into a world of bytes
            and binary, to never look back at a time without it. </p>

        <span class="border"></span>
        <p> Harvik Kesineni is a senior at Orlando Science High School. He started learning about programming
            and computer science in his 7th-grade computer science class. Since then, he has been working
            closely with computer science-related activities like his school Robotics Team Clockwork Mania.
            He is a member of the Computer Science Honor Society and designed websites there. Because
            of competitions and self-interest, he has learned web development, python, java, and VBA. Building
            websites is an opportunity for him to test his limits on what he can program and shared interest
            among his friends. </p>
